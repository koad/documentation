# Component Pieces

I like to have things work together.  The ability to make component pieces that operate as a single unit.

I use several individual fundamental parts to create a foundation where all else can be derived.

these components become the standardized koad:io stack.

any one of these can be used by itself,  the magic is in the synergistic effect of combining them.

the layers I put on top of these items becomes my `kingdom`, or `barn` as Scott would say.  It is a space in the digital real estate that exists within my files and folders.  It's an operating system for __me__, one that is independent from any one device.



## Sandstorm

Sandstorm give me ability to create independant sandboxes and send invites out directly to people I want to interact with.  The sandbox could contain whatever I want, whether its a spreadsheet, whiteboard or chess game. 

The sandboxing here is done in a way where the software running in the sandbox has no way to call out into the internet, so it is very secure.


## eCoinCore

eCoinCore collects information about blockchains out in the wild.  It organizes and maintains connections to these blockchains and relays these connections into the rest of my kingdom.  This is like a VPN for blockchains, as no third party can view my queries.


## Keybase

Keybase, although does not pass my strict open source edict, it's client side software does.  I realize keybase is a third party, but for some of my peers who find it impossible to install anything more than entry level software, Keybase is my go-to and last resort.

Keybases advanced features depend on the internet itself, and there is no self-hosted choice for their serverside functionality.  There is a 1 million CDN bounty for the development of a keybase server-side replacement, it will kick in when CDN is > 10$ CAD.


## Matrix

Matrix allows for communication throughout my kingdom.  Channels and messages exist only within the peers involved.

Matrix channels are used to control application config and logic.  It is useful for signaling within multi-user applications within and outside of the kingdom.


## Meteor

Meteor is a toolbox that allows me to standardize and deploy content specific apps/sites/templates that connect into my kingdom.  The data witnessed within eCoinCore, Keybase and Matrix are all brought together and made available in my standard koad:io environment.



# Summary

Listed here are a few of the most fundamental tools used in my daily life.  This is not a complete list of everything, but it is a list of components that exist within the majority of the work within this repo.
