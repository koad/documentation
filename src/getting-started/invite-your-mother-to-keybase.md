Creating a GPG key can be a good idea for anyone who wants to secure their digital communications, including your mother. GPG (GNU Privacy Guard) is a free and open-source software for encrypting and signing messages and files. By creating a GPG key, your mother can encrypt sensitive information, such as passwords or financial data, and ensure that only the intended recipient can read it. Additionally, she can use the key to digitally sign emails or other files, providing an extra layer of authentication.

Keybase is a good option for creating and managing GPG keys. Keybase provides a user-friendly interface for generating and managing GPG keys, and also offers secure messaging and file sharing features.

One of the advantages of using Keybase for GPG key management is that it makes it easy to verify the identity of other Keybase users, which can be helpful in ensuring that your mother is communicating securely with the right person. Keybase also integrates with various online services, such as GitHub and Reddit, allowing your mother to use her Keybase identity to sign commits or verify her identity on other platforms.

Using Git for family photos would allow you to keep track of changes and collaborate with other family members on edits and additions to the photo collection. You could create different branches for different types of photos, such as family events, vacations, or individual family members, and merge changes as needed.

Keybase can be a good choice for managing her keys and communicating securely. However, as with any security tool, it's important to understand the limitations and potential risks, and to use best practices for key management and secure communication.
