## ISP's router vs. 3rd party

It is __highly__ recommended to use your own router/firewall even if your internet service provider (ISP) has provided you with one. Here are some reasons why:

- Enhanced security: While ISPs usually provide basic routers/firewalls, they may not provide the same level of security as third-party options. Using your own router/firewall can provide additional security features, such as VPN support, intrusion detection and prevention, and more advanced parental controls.  
- Customization: With your own router/firewall, you have greater control over the configuration and settings of your network. This allows you to customize your security settings to better fit your needs, and you can also customize other settings such as the network name, Wi-Fi password, and other settings to your liking.  
- Better performance: Using your own router/firewall can also improve your network's performance. Third-party routers/firewalls may offer better Wi-Fi range, faster speeds, and other features that can improve the overall performance of your network.  
- Better privacy: Some ISPs may track your online activity and use this data for targeted advertising or other purposes. By using your own router/firewall, you can help protect your privacy by using features like VPNs to encrypt your traffic and prevent your ISP from tracking your online activity.  

In summary, while your ISP may provide a router/firewall, using your own can offer enhanced security, customization, better performance, and better privacy. It's important to do your research and choose a router/firewall that fits your needs and budget.

## USB drives and ports

Exposed USB ports can be a security issue, as they can be used to introduce malware or viruses onto a computer or device. When you plug a USB drive or other device into an exposed USB port, it can potentially install malicious software onto your computer without your knowledge.

One common attack method is called "USB drop" or "USB baiting", in which attackers leave infected USB drives in public places in the hopes that someone will pick them up and plug them into their computer. Once the infected drive is inserted, the malware can spread to the computer and potentially steal sensitive information or damage the system.

To protect against this type of attack, it is recommended to avoid using untrusted USB drives and to keep USB ports covered or disabled when not in use. Additionally, it is important to keep your anti-virus software up to date and to regularly scan your system for malware or viruses.
