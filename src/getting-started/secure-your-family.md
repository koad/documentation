It is a good idea to help your elderly relatives learn how to protect themselves online. Elderly individuals can be particularly vulnerable to online scams and fraud, and may be less familiar with the technology and best practices for staying safe online.

Here are some things you can do to help your elderly relatives:

- Talk to them about the risks: Take the time to explain the risks associated with using the internet, such as online scams and phishing attempts, and help them understand how to recognize and avoid these threats.  
- Teach them best practices: Show your elderly relatives how to use strong passwords, avoid clicking on suspicious links or downloading unknown attachments, and how to adjust privacy settings on their devices.  
- Help them set up security software: Install and configure security software, such as anti-virus and anti-malware software, on their devices to help protect against cyber threats.  
- Be patient and understanding: Remember that your elderly relatives may need more time and support to learn how to protect themselves online, and may have different perspectives or experiences with technology. Be patient and understanding as you work with them to improve their online safety.  

By helping your elderly relatives learn how to protect themselves online, you can help them avoid common online scams and stay safe and secure while using the internet.
