## Consider the possibilities

I don't suggest you go and cancel all your online accounts;  securing yourself starts with learning and planning.  Building and organizing your kingdom can be a fun and fulfilling process;  take your time, enjoy the growth that is happening within during this time.  As you look out and recognize that which you do not what, you (in that moment) `realize` (that is, `make-real`) that which you do want.  Act when you are inspired to do so.  

One thought at a time, you can choose again.


## During your contemplation, please keep these things in mind

### Trust 
- trust nothing you hear, and only half of what you see.
- trust is not given freely, it builds over the course of time.
- trust is not good or bad, it is the result an interaction.
- you cannot `not trust` somebody/something; you can only trust your feelings.
- if you `have to trust` something, you cannot.

### Standards
- don't look for reasons to use something, look for reasons NOT to use something.
- the instant you recognize a flaw in the design, start looking for an alternative.
- be aware of the entrusted custodian, and avoid him at all costs.

### Freedom
- freedom is not free, it bears the greatest cost of all: responsibility.
- freedom is not having to trust, freedom is proof; proof is transparency.

### Evidence
- everything you say online is permanent, you can never take it back.
- everything you say online can be used against you in the `court of law` and `the court of public opinion`.
- your word is your bond; - you have the right to `remain silent`.
- your thoughts published into the `permanent media` become your `self declared convictions`.
