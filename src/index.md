# My sweetest friend
<!-- # Why are you _now_ __here__? -->

## If you are a _low-tech person_, it would benefit you the most to take a pass through the first half of the [getting started](https://docs.koad.sh/getting-started/) guide.  It outlines basic understandings anyone with internet access should possess.  A little bit of knowledge can go a long way to help you stay safe online.

## The rise of a new dimension of space-time.  

You can now build things and ideas in a space that is eternal.  The singularity will happen to you when you let your brain enjoy the tools of this new space-time and join others in communities of like mind.  Your work done today can be built upon by future versions of yourself; provided it has been collected, processed, organized, reviewed and acted on.  This process is the key.

## Keep it simple and stupid.

Simple single-use apps can be tied together in your mind and project boards.  You do not need or want any `all-in-one` app or device which will always result in less capable overall abilities. 

## Thoughts become things  

- these are your projects
- a project is an idea that drives you to action

projects can show up at any time, prepare to capture them and push them into a reliable system to accomplish any actionable items that are required to complete the `project`

<!-- "in the beginning, __God said__" -->


## Organized Reality.

You likely already don't remember any phone numbers, because you `trust your system` and your mind has been able to `let it go`.

This is not about security, privacy and freedom.  It is about skill+abilities, connectedness and `ease of flow`. `Security, privacy and freedom` just happen to get dealt with as a matter of principal.

The more you can `just get it done` in `the moment` the more you will get done.  If you can out perform your competition, you will most certainly achieve more of what you want.
