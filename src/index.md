The practice of keeping project lists is a common habit among highly effective individuals, as it allows them to track their progress and stay focused on their goals. By tracking their goals and breaking them into actionable tasks, individuals can create a systematic approach to achieving their desired outcomes.

This approach can be seen as a form of manifestation, as thoughts and ideas become more concrete and achievable when they are organized and tracked. By keeping track of their progress, individuals can also gain a sense of accomplishment and motivation, which can further fuel their progress towards their goals.

In essence, the act of creating and maintaining project lists is a way of bringing thoughts and ideas into the physical world, allowing individuals to transform their dreams and aspirations into reality through a systematic and organized approach. This practice can be a powerful tool for personal growth and achievement, and can be applied to a wide range of goals and projects in both personal and professional contexts.
