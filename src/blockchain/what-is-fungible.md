# What is fungible?


## What is a fungible token?

A fungible token is a type of digital asset that is interchangeable with another identical token, in terms of value and function. In other words, each token is indistinguishable from any other token of the same type, and can be used interchangeably without affecting its value or function.

Fungible tokens are commonly used in cryptocurrency and blockchain applications. For example, popular cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin and Ethereum are fungible tokens, where each unit of the currency has the same value and can be used interchangeably.

Fungible tokens are often contrasted with non-fungible tokens (NFTs), which are unique and cannot be exchanged or replicated. For example, an NFT representing a digital artwork or collectible is unique and cannot be exchanged for another identical NFT.

Overall, fungible tokens are useful for creating a standardized unit of value that can be easily exchanged and traded, without the need for individual verification or identification.


## What is a non-fungible token (NFT)?

A non-fungible token (NFT) is a type of digital asset that represents ownership or proof of authenticity of a unique item or piece of content, such as digital art, collectibles, or in-game items. Unlike fungible tokens, each NFT is unique and cannot be exchanged or replicated, making it one-of-a-kind.

NFTs are created using blockchain technology, where they are stored and verified across a decentralized network of nodes. This makes NFTs highly secure and resistant to fraud or tampering, ensuring that the ownership and authenticity of the digital asset can be traced and verified.

NFTs can be bought and sold on various online marketplaces, and their value is determined by factors such as the rarity, popularity, and uniqueness of the underlying digital asset. The transaction history of NFTs is publicly visible on the blockchain, enabling transparency and authenticity of ownership.

NFTs have gained popularity in recent years, particularly in the world of art and collectibles. They provide a way for creators and collectors to monetize and showcase their digital assets, while also providing a way to authenticate and verify the ownership of unique digital content.



## What is a non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace?

A non-fungible token (NFT) marketplace is an online platform that facilitates the buying, selling, and trading of NFTs. These marketplaces provide a marketplace for creators to showcase and monetize their unique digital assets, and for buyers to browse and purchase these assets.

NFT marketplaces typically operate on blockchain networks, where NFTs are stored and verified across a decentralized network of nodes. This ensures the authenticity and ownership of each NFT, and provides transparency in terms of transaction history and ownership.

Some popular NFT marketplaces include OpenSea, SuperRare, Nifty Gateway, and Rarible, each with their own set of features and offerings. These marketplaces allow creators to mint their own NFTs, set their own prices, and receive royalties on subsequent sales. Buyers can browse and purchase NFTs using various cryptocurrencies or fiat currencies, depending on the platform.

NFT marketplaces have gained popularity in recent years, particularly in the world of art and collectibles. They provide a way for creators and collectors to participate in a new and innovative market, and for buyers to own and showcase unique digital assets.
