# What is a hacker?


## What is a white hat hacker?

A white hat hacker is a computer security expert who uses their skills to identify and fix security vulnerabilities and weaknesses in computer systems, networks, and applications. White hat hackers work to improve security and protect against cyber threats, often by working with organizations to test and improve their security measures. Unlike black hat hackers who use their skills for malicious purposes, white hat hackers are ethical and follow a code of conduct to ensure they operate within legal and ethical boundaries. Some white hat hackers may work as independent consultants, while others may be employed by companies to help protect their networks and systems from cyber attacks.


## What is a black hat hacker?

A black hat hacker is a person who uses their computer skills to gain unauthorized access to computer systems and networks for malicious purposes, such as stealing data, disrupting systems, or causing harm to individuals or organizations. Black hat hackers often operate with the intent to commit cyber crimes, including identity theft, fraud, and extortion. They may use a variety of techniques and tools to exploit vulnerabilities in computer systems and networks, and they may work alone or as part of a criminal organization. Unlike ethical hackers (white hat hackers), black hat hackers are motivated by personal gain or malicious intent and operate outside the bounds of the law and ethical standards. It is important to note that engaging in black hat hacking is illegal and can lead to serious consequences, including imprisonment and fines.


## what is a red team?

A red team is a group of skilled security professionals who simulate attacks on computer systems, networks, and applications to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses in the security infrastructure. The primary goal of a red team is to test the effectiveness of an organization's security measures by attempting to breach their defenses through a variety of methods. Red teams may use a variety of techniques to simulate real-world attacks, including social engineering, phishing, and vulnerability scanning. The results of their testing help organizations identify and address weaknesses in their security posture and improve their overall security defenses. In contrast to a blue team, which is responsible for defending against attacks, the red team's role is to identify vulnerabilities and provide recommendations for remediation. The use of red teams is becoming increasingly popular in industries such as finance, healthcare, and technology, as companies seek to improve their security posture and protect against cyber threats.
