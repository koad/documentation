## What is a whitepaper?

In the context of cryptocurrency and blockchain technology, a whitepaper is a document that outlines the concept, design, and technical details of a specific project. It serves as a blueprint for the project and is usually published by the team or individuals behind the project to provide transparency and credibility to potential investors and users.

A whitepaper typically includes information about the problem the project aims to solve, the proposed solution, the technology that will be used, the team behind the project, the roadmap and timeline, the token economics, and other relevant information. Whitepapers are often used as a tool to attract funding for the project through initial coin offerings (ICOs) or other crowdfunding mechanisms.

The term "whitepaper" has its origins in traditional business and government circles, where it refers to a document that lays out a particular issue, policy, or proposal in a clear and concise manner, often in the form of a report or analysis. In the cryptocurrency and blockchain space, the term has come to refer specifically to a document that describes a new project or technology in detail.

## What is a roadmap?

A roadmap is a document that outlines the high-level goals, plans, and milestones for a project or organization. It provides a visual representation of how the project or organization plans to achieve its objectives over a certain period of time, often spanning months or years.

In the context of cryptocurrency and blockchain projects, a roadmap may include items such as the development of new features, integration with other systems or networks, community outreach, partnerships, and other initiatives. It can be a helpful tool for stakeholders, investors, and users to understand the trajectory of a project and assess its potential for success.
