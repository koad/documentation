Eventually I will make a program that prints a daily worksheet that I can use to track theses items.  I use this space here to collect the relevant ideas first.

## Top 6

Although this may not fill my day, my day shall be filled with some of each.

- Fix something
- Learn something
- Clean something
- Create something
- Improve something
- Appreciate something
- ________ something


## Health

Mood: Include fields to track your mood, such as a rating scale or a brief description of how you felt throughout the day.

Food diary: Include a field to track the foods you eat each day. This can help you identify any trigger foods that may be causing symptoms.

Symptom tracker: Include a field to track any symptoms you experience each day, such as bloating, headaches, or fatigue. This can help you identify any patterns or correlations between your symptoms and the foods you eat.

Supplement tracker: If you are taking any supplements as part of your elimination diet program, include a field to track them.

Sleep: Include fields to track your sleep, as getting enough rest can also support your digestive system.

Physical activity: Include fields to track your physical activity, as regular exercise can also support your digestive system.


## Consumption

Gas meter reading: Include a field to track the current reading on your gas meter. You may also want to include a field to track the date of the reading.

Hydro meter reading: Include a field to track the current reading on your hydro meter. You may also want to include a field to track the date of the reading.

Usage comparison: You can also include a field to compare your current gas and hydro meter readings with the previous readings to track your usage over time. This can help you identify any changes in usage and make adjustments as needed.


## Calendar

Calendar items from Caldav instance


## QR code.

Hashing the form's source file into the QR code can provide a way to identify the specific version of the worksheet, which can be useful for tracking changes and ensuring consistency.

You can use a hash function such as SHA-256 to generate a unique identifier for the form's source file, and then include this identifier in the QR code along with the date and other relevant information.

When the worksheet is scanned in the future, the program can use the QR code to extract the identifier and other information, and then use this to locate the corresponding form source file and extract the data. This can help ensure that the data is correctly associated with the correct version of the worksheet.
