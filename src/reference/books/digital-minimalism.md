Digital Minimalism - Choosing a Focused Life in a Noisy World  
by Cal Newport


A New York Times, Wall Street Journal, Publishers Weekly, and USA Today bestseller

> Newport is making a bid to be the Marie Kondo of technology: someone with an actual plan for helping you realize the digital pursuits that do, and don't, bring value to your life.
--Ezra Klein, Vox

__Minimalism is the art of knowing how much is just enough. Digital minimalism applies this idea to our personal technology. It's the key to living a focused life in an increasingly noisy world.__
