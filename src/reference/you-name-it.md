## Give it all a name


To help your mind organize your digital world, it is important to give everything meaningful names.  You will have a better understanding of where and what makes up your digital space.


## How I do it

Here are the names of some of my things.

### Computers  
have names of places, because you will store your `thing` there, in a place.  

- `pieye` : my raspberry pi that runs `pihole`, my eyes inside my `local area network (LAN)`
- `wonderland` :  this is my current daily driver.  Its name is wonderland so my screenshots look good when I share things that `alice` can do


### External Storage  
named in a way where you can identify it physically, so I know for sure what drive I am using in the file explorer

- `ROG1T` :  My USB-C external storage, 1TB in size and installed in an Asus ROG enclosure. 

For USB drives, I will colour the side of them with a sharpie and label them with that colour because otherwise they would all look the same.

- `K4GREEN` :  My 4GB kingston USB drive with the green sharpie marks on it  
- `K4GOLD` :  My 4GB kingston USB drive with the gold sharpie marks on it  

Green for the money, gold for the honey.  


### Folders and Repos

named by description, with dashes instead of spaces.

There is no mistaking the contents of the folder/repo.

- `last-will-and-testament`
- `linux-desktop-launchers`


### Entities  

My replacement for Siri, Alexia and that other double agent.  
[(a folder for a category of projects)](https://book.koad.sh/reference/koad-io-entity/) 

has people names, because I address them in the same way.  
ie: >`alice gather `

- `marsha` : a folder that contains the canadaecoin projects
- `pandora` : a folder that contains the ecoincore projects
- `astro` : a folder that contains my personal projects
- `alice` :    Alice is a reference version of a koad:io entity that I use to showcase the koad:io methodology.



## summary

don't just play as a non participating observer;  make your techno-space something that is truely yours; truely you.   

Be intentional and keep it organized.
