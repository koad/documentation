# Adopt keyboard shortcuts

Keyboard shortcuts are a set of keys that, when pressed in combination, perform a specific action on a computer. They are a powerful tool that can help you save time and increase your productivity by reducing the need for repetitive mouse clicks and menu selections. 

By using keyboard shortcuts, you can save several seconds or even minutes of time per action. Over the course of a day or week, this can add up to significant time savings, allowing you to be more productive and accomplish more tasks in less time.

## 6,400 hours of time saved

It's difficult to estimate exactly how much time an information worker would save over a 40 year career by using keyboard shortcuts, as it depends on a variety of factors, such as how frequently the worker uses a computer, how many keyboard shortcuts they use, and how much time each shortcut saves on average.

However, let's consider a hypothetical scenario where an information worker uses a computer for an average of 8 hours per day, 5 days per week, for 48 weeks per year (assuming a 4 week vacation), for a total of 1,920 hours per year. Let's also assume that the worker uses keyboard shortcuts for an average of 5 minutes per hour, or 40 minutes per day, which equates to 3.33 hours per week, or 160 hours per year.

Assuming the worker begins their career at age 22 and retires at age 62, this amounts to a total of 160 hours per year x 40 years = 6,400 hours of time saved by using keyboard shortcuts over the course of their career.

While this is a rough estimate and may not be entirely accurate, it does illustrate how using keyboard shortcuts can add up to significant time savings over the course of a long career.

## Create your own

Overall, creating your own keyboard shortcuts can help you work more efficiently and get more done in less time. It can also make your computer more personalized and easier to use, which can help improve your overall computing experience.


### Windows

Create a shortcut for the program or file you want to create a keyboard shortcut for. To do this, right-click on the program or file, select "Create shortcut", and move the shortcut to a convenient location such as the desktop.

- Right-click on the shortcut and select "Properties" from the context menu.  

- In the "Properties" dialog box, select the "Shortcut" tab.  

- Click on the "Shortcut key" field, and then press the key combination you want to use for your keyboard shortcut. For example, you could use "Ctrl+Alt+T" for a shortcut to open a particular program.  

- Click "Apply" and then "OK" to save your changes.  

- Test your new keyboard shortcut by pressing the key combination you assigned to it.  

Note that some keyboard shortcuts may be already in use by other programs or functions on your computer, so you may need to choose a different key combination if the one you want is already taken.


### Mac

You can create your own keyboard shortcuts on a Mac using the built-in "Keyboard Shortcuts" feature. Here's how:

- Go to the "Apple" menu in the top-left corner of your screen, then select "System Preferences".  

- Click on "Keyboard", then select the "Shortcuts" tab.  

- In the left pane, select the category you want to create a keyboard shortcut for (e.g. "App Shortcuts").  

- Click the "+" button at the bottom of the right pane to create a new shortcut.  

- In the dialog box that appears, enter the exact name of the menu command you want to assign a shortcut to (this is case-sensitive), then enter the keyboard shortcut you want to use.  

- Click "Add" to save your new keyboard shortcut.  

- Test your new keyboard shortcut by using the key combination you assigned to it.  

Note that not all applications support custom keyboard shortcuts, and some may override your custom shortcut with their own default shortcut. Additionally, some keyboard shortcuts may be already in use by other programs or functions on your Mac, so you may need to choose a different key combination if the one you want is already taken.




### linux

You can create your own keyboard shortcuts on Linux as well. The process may vary depending on which Linux distribution you are using, but here are the general steps:

- Open your system settings or preferences panel.  

- Look for the "Keyboard" or "Keyboard Shortcuts" option and click on it.  

- Look for the option to create a new keyboard shortcut or edit an existing one.  

- Enter the key combination you want to use for your shortcut.  

- Enter the command or function you want to associate with the shortcut. This can be a specific program or function on your computer, or a custom command or script.  

- Save your changes and test the new keyboard shortcut.  

Keep in mind that the process may vary depending on which Linux distribution and desktop environment you are using. Some desktop environments, such as GNOME, may have built-in tools for creating custom keyboard shortcuts, while others may require you to use command line tools or edit configuration files manually. Be sure to consult your distribution's documentation or community forums for more information on how to create keyboard shortcuts on your specific system.
