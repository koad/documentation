GTD stands for Getting Things Done, which is a productivity and time-management system created by David Allen. The GTD methodology is designed to help individuals become more organized, efficient, and productive in their personal and professional lives.

At its core, GTD is a five-step process for managing tasks and projects:

- Capture: Collect all the things that need your attention into a single list, whether they're tasks, projects, or ideas.  

- Clarify: Process the items on your list one-by-one, determining what needs to be done and whether it's actionable.  

- Organize: Sort and categorize your tasks and projects, assigning them to specific contexts or categories based on when, where, or how they can be completed.  

- Reflect: Review your lists and make decisions about what you need to focus on next, based on your priorities and resources.  

- Engage: Take action on your tasks and projects, using the context and resources available to you to complete them efficiently.  

The GTD methodology emphasizes the importance of having a clear and organized system for managing tasks and projects, which can help reduce stress and increase productivity. It also emphasizes the need for regular reviews and reflection to ensure that you are focused on the most important tasks and making progress towards your goals.
