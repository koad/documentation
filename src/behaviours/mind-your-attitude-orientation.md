The orientation of a person's attitude refers to the overall direction or inclination of their thoughts and beliefs towards a particular subject or topic. Attitude orientation can be positive or negative, and can have a significant impact on a person's behavior and decisions.

A positive attitude orientation involves seeing the good in people, situations, and things. People with a positive attitude tend to be optimistic, enthusiastic, and resilient in the face of challenges. They believe that their efforts can make a difference, and they are more likely to take risks and pursue their goals with determination.

On the other hand, a negative attitude orientation involves focusing on the bad in people, situations, and things. People with a negative attitude tend to be pessimistic, cynical, and easily discouraged. They may believe that they are helpless to change their circumstances, and may give up on their goals or become resigned to their situation.

It is important to note that a person's attitude orientation can vary depending on the context and situation. For example, someone may have a positive attitude towards their career, but a negative attitude towards their personal relationships. Additionally, a person's attitude orientation can be influenced by their upbringing, life experiences, and the people around them.

Overall, the orientation of a person's attitude can have a significant impact on their success, happiness, and well-being. By cultivating a positive attitude orientation and focusing on the good in people and situations, individuals can increase their resilience, motivation, and overall satisfaction with life.

I'm going to look for ways that I can feel better.

I am going de-clutter my experience.
I am going de-clutter my relationships.
I am going de-clutter my mind.

I am gong to be nicer to me.
I'm going to leave not good feeling stuff behind.
I'm going to leave behind things that don't feel good; thoughts, relationships stuff.

I'm going to talk less often to that person who always brings me down.
I'm going to think less often about that thought that always puts a knot in the pit of my stomach.
