# Need help?

If you aren't comfortable with linux or computers in general _then_ __please reach out to a loved one__ and ask them to look through this content with you.

It will be best to find someone who is capable to operate these services for your family/community.

## level up, create your family a meta-kingdom.

this guide will walk you through creating a space where the code and references available throughout my tutorials will work and make sense.

After following this `setup guide`, you will have

- Family/Community disaster action plans
- Recovery seed keys and instructions
- A home communications server (matrix synapse)
- A hosted matrix chat app (element)
- A hosted zoom like conference (jitsi)
- A hosted sandstorm instance
- koad:io with an entity
- An environment where you rest assured is safe from external custodians
- An environment where you can create and host future web sites/services

Once complete, you will have everything in place to enjoy private and reliable interaction with your loved ones in unique spaces for the many __contexts__ in your life.

These things can be used to identify and verify your loved ones as well as interact with them with the __knowing__ that you are interacting with the right person.
